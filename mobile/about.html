  <p>Hailing from Columbus, Ohio, Wait for the Day is a metal band with a focus on emotional choruses and ambience. Formed in early 2016 by guitarist Nick Lyons, guitarist Kovy Arseneau, and singer Doug Katula, the band released their debut EP “The Losing Sight Collection” in March of 2018. Bassist Jonah Young joined soon after its release, with drummer Bradon Studebaker following shortly after. The group independently wrote and recorded their first full length with Will Carlson titled “The Sun Will Drown” with the intention of breaking metalcore norms through their eclectic background in other genres of music: such as jazz/fusion, technical death metal, christian contemporary music, and post hardcore.

Their debut album “The Sun Will Drown” is now available everywhere.</p>
